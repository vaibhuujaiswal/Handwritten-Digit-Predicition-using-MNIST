# Handwritten-Digit-Predicition-using-MNIST

## Important points regarding the code : 

1. I have used **Multilayer Perceptron** which uses a **500 dimensioned hidden layer**. The total number of trainable characters are 397550
2. I have used *PyTorch* rather than tensor flow because I am more comfortable with it. 
3. I had tried it for different learning rates and epochs. In this case, I have taken a learning rate of 0.2. I could have taken 0.5, but I feel it worked for 10 epochs for me.
4. As an activation function, I have used **rectified linear Function (ReLU)** directly using the PyTorch format given
5. I have used **Stochastic Gradient Descent** as it gave the output using less time and less computational resources
6. To calculate the loss function I have used the **cross-entropy function**.
7. IDE used : *jupyter notebook*
8. 92 percent accuracy.

## Output of the code : 
Test accuracy: **0.9287999868392944**
tensor(9288.)
